A Java application for managing 'todo' tasks, developed for university 2nd year programming module.

Alternate versions for Command Line Interface (CLIMenu.java) and Graphical User Interface (GUI.java and Menu.java) which share the other files. The GUI version features file persistence, by writing the 'todo' objects to a .txt file, with each task as a new line, properties/attributes separated by commas. It can also load the tasks back from a .txt file, provided the txt file is formatted as described.

The coursework brief is uploaded in the repository and so is the marker's feedback. I scored 97% for this assignment.

Admittedly, I shouldn't really have used the 'command line application' template in IntelliJ IDEA when setting up the project, because that automatically packages all of the classes/interfaces/enums etc into a package named 'com.company', which presumably meant the marker had to do a little refactoring of my code in order to compile and run it.
