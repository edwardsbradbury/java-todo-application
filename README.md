# java-todo-application

A Java application for managing 'todo' tasks, developed for university 2nd year programming module.

Alternate versions for Command Line Interface (CLIMenu.java) and GUI (GUI.java and Menu.java) which share the other files. The GUI version features file persistence, by writing the 'todo' objects to a .txt file, with each task as a new line, properties/attributes separated by commas. It can also load the tasks back from a .txt file, provided the txt file is formatted as described.

The coursework brief is uploaded in the repository and so is the marker's feedback. I scored 97% for this assignment.
